<h3>Coin-image animation and resposive lightbox</h3>

<h5>Why this script?</h5>
This script started like a game in a boring moment. At the end, it comes something useful. So i decided to make it better and share it.
I know, that isn't Fancybox.




<h5>Known bugs and problems</h5>
<ul>
  <li>The actual element option leads to 0 everytime window is resized.</li>
  <li>After window's resize, key next/prev make crazy things!</li>
  <li>For now, doesn't support link on image, and not even html codes.</li>
</ul>
